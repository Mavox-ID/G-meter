Hardware Check

If the device doesn't have an accelerometer, the app notifies you and automatically closes. The user immediately sees a notification that the app won't work without this sensor.

More Accurate G-Force Measurements

In addition to the accelerometer, gyroscope, gravity, and linear acceleration data are taken into account, improving accuracy.

Improved Information Display

Minimum, maximum, and current g-force values ‚Äã‚Äãare displayed in real time.

The interface has become slightly more informative and intuitive.

App Controls

Pause/Resume buttons to pause/resume measurements.

Reset button to reset all data.

Interactive Footer

## üõ° Ensuring safety (no malware)

I can't force antivirus vendors to mark files as clean, but I **only provide official builds** in the Releases section and on Google Play.  

If you find any suspicious behavior, **do not install the app** and contact me immediately.

Verification tips:
- Check the APK source and SHA256 checksum.  
- Scan the APK with antivirus tools like VirusTotal.  
- Inspect permissions before installing.
