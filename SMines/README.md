## 🛡 Ensuring safety (no malware)

I can't force antivirus vendors to mark files as clean, but I **only provide official builds** in the Releases section and on Google Play.  

If you find any suspicious behavior, **do not install the app** and contact me immediately.

Verification tips:
- Check the APK source and SHA256 checksum.  
- Scan the APK with antivirus tools like VirusTotal.  
- Inspect permissions before installing.
